    <h1> Cloud Computing</h1>
Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data and applications over the internet instead of on local servers or personal computers. It offers scalable resources,
enabling businesses and individuals to use computing power, storage, and applications on-demand.
<br>
<br>
Key characteristics include:
<br>
<br>
On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision resources as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.
<br>
<br>
Broad Network Access: Services are accessible over the internet from various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.
<br>
<br>
Resource Pooling: Providers use a multi-tenant model to serve multiple clients, dynamically assigning and reallocating resources based on demand.
<br>
<br>
Rapid Elasticity: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet changing needs.
<br>
<br>
Measured Service: Usage is monitored and controlled, providing transparency for both providers and consumers.
<br>
<br>
Types of cloud computing include:
<br>
<br>

Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple clients (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure).
<br>
<br>
Private Cloud: Services are maintained on a private network for a single organization, providing more control and security.
<br>
<br>
Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
<br>
<br>
Cloud computing enhances flexibility, reduces costs, and improves collaboration, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes.
